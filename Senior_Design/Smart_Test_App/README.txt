The folder contains the java source code as well as the libraries, OpenCV, to execute my senior design project. The program is designed to incorporate multiple authentication techniques into a single application. Facial recognition, keystroke dynamics, and a basic username and password were combined to create a gatway to accessing a secondary application.
	The premise of the application was to create a way for teachers to feel more comfortable when administering a test online. The user has to go through
an enrollment process where they have to take 10 picturs of their face, preferably from different angles so that the algorithm can capture an appropriate profile for them. Following that, the user will be prompted to type a keyword or phrase 10 times to generate statistics about how that user types the keyword or phrase. Once the enrollment process is complete, the user will be able to login with the established username and password, a picture, and typing the keyword/phrase correctly.
